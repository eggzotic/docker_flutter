# counter_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. To run it interactively, as a first check:

```BASH
flutter run -d chrome
```

To prepare a build, ready for deployment into a Docker container/app:

```BASH
flutter build web
```

This is a streamlined version of the Flutter starter counter application, with the web platform assumed to be the only one of interest.
